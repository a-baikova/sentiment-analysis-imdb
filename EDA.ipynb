The story's protagonist is a bisexual alcoholic Catholic writer, Gerard (Krabbe), with a seriously twisted sense of imagination. Verhoeven offers up Gerard has an example of everything wrong with the modern man. He's shiftless, delusional, unable to control his urges, afraid to commit to meaningful relationships, and utterly apathetic about life in general. As the character himself states at one point, he is a professional liar, unable to recall the truth. The movie opens with Gerard dreaming of spiders consuming Christ, and then waking to begin the long march to his own destruction. He chases off one man (a boyfriend presumably), then chases another at a train station. Later, at a lecture, he meets a woman who seems to want to help him, or perhaps she has more nefarious plans.. She quickly captures Gerard in her web, enticing him with sex and money, having plenty of both. She's also got secrets, like three dead husbands. Is she lonely, and genuinely looking for someone to nurture   or is she a deadly black widow, luring Gerard to his death? Will Garard be the 4th man she kills? The woman is Christine (Soutendijk), and Verhoeven does his best to keep you guessing what she's up to. This is an interesting movie, with a lot of sex and intrigue. It's similar to Verhoeven's<em>Basic instinct< em>, but has a lot more depth, and is certainly more shocking. There's a lot of very strong gay content, which may make some viewers squirm. Highly recommended for fans of intelligent psychological thrillers, or anyone looking for something entirely new.\",\n          \"Remember the chain smoking channeler exposed on 60 Minutes a few years ago? This is her. Lots of folks reviewed this movie without checking the bona fides of the filmmakers. The producers have been using phony \\\"word of mouth\\\" promotions very successfully without disclosing the financial and philosophical underpinnings for this piece of marketing tripe. If you believe in channeling, reincarnation, new age dreck and day old baloney, this film is for you. If you want a discussion of quantum physics or reality, look elsewhere. The purpose of this movie is to convince you that Ramtha isn't a wacko, so you'll give her a bunch of your money. If you can tiptoe through the Ramtha website without howling in disbelief, then maybe you'll think the bucks you dropped on this infomercial for insanity was well spent. <http:  rogerebert.suntimes.com apps pbcs.dll section?category=ANSWERMAN>\",\n          \"Contains spoilers \\\"Hollow Man\\\" is probably the weakest movie that Paul Verhoeven, director of great movies like \\\"Total Recall\\\", \\\"Starship Troopers\\\" and \\\"Robocop\\\" has ever made.  That's probably not his fault. For some reason, Verhoeven got stuck with an utterly mediocre script, and he made the best of it.  The first part of this movie is rather good, with lots of cynical jokes, great special effects and even Skunk Anansie on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, the movie falls flat in the second part, were it degenerates into a standard slasher movie or maybe a very bad \\\"Alien\\\" clone. The ending is especially ridiculous <SPOILER>, as Kevin Bacon keeps coming back to life after a number of incidents that should (in the logical sense of the word) have killed him. < SPOILER>. And the entire thing is quite shallow, indeed: the subject of becoming invisible is never fully investigated. But all in all, Verhoeven manages to stay well above average with this movie.  **1 2 out of **** stars\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"neg\",\n          \"pos\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["> Durante a análise inicial dos dados, observou-se a presença de diversas **tags HTML** no texto das reviews.  \n","Além das tags normais, foram encontrados casos atípicos como `< i>` e `< e>`, que fogem aos padrões tradicionais de HTML e que também necessitam de ser removidos.\n","\n","> Apesar disso, aplicar uma regra geral para eliminar qualquer conteúdo entre sinais de `< >` poderia trazer problemas.

I supposed I am quite obsessed by chess, but hopefully not as much as the central character in this film. In this film, the central character reflects a real chess player called Curt von Bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924. He is famous for a game he played against Steinitz, where a beautiful combination was played by Steinitz. Instead of resigning, he simply walked out of the tournament hall, never to return. The social ineptness of the central character is unfortunately a treat of some of the more serious Grandmasters you sometimes get in chess tournaments. Chess I suppose is a very big sacrifice, and you can sometimes end up imbalanced in other areas of life. A major example of this is the chess legend Bobby Fischer. Although a genius, he was also very disturbed in many ways. In the film, a World championship match is depicted, as between an Italian Grandmaster and Luzhin. The format is a knockout, which actually the world Governing body of Fide has sometimes employed as a format itself   going from 128 players to just 2 in the final. But this was a group knockout   which also depicts a realistic format, where the winners of each group play against each other. The position before adjournment makes for a fascinating chess puzzle in itself.

Not only were the characters and actors right on, but these are a very talented set of actors. The concept and idea is really a new and cool idea for a TV show, many of us share this whole idea of \"connections\". I really love the characters of Steven, Laura, Whitney and Damien. But to be honest there is not one person connected to this show that I did not like, even those that only were in for a few episodes (Sheri Appleby for example). The acting and characters are so easy to like and so talented!!. I wish ABC had given this show more of a chance, and not interrupted the show midway, Also it was not advertised enough. Truly unfair!! to everyone!!. This show showed great promise. I for one will let ABC know how I feel and will keep sending emails to keep this show alive. Please join me, I know we can do it. It worked for Jerico. (By the way where is episode 13? I want that last show!). Please support this show and send emails to ABC,we can do it!!! This show is well worth it!!!

SIGN THIS PETITION ASAP!!!   \n","423  Currently on METOO's new schedule at 4 pm on weekdays, right after \"Maverick\" and right before \"Wild, Wild West\" (followed by \"Star Trek\"). Don't know if I ever actually saw an episode of it when it was originally on, but I'm really captivated by it. Offbeat, unusual, surreal stories set in a mythical West. Kind of the \"Naked City\" of Westerns. And the guest stars are there: Dan Duryea, Lyle Bettger, Brian Donlevy, MacDonald Carey, Rick Jason (as a treacherous Mexican), a young Dick Van Patten, Jack Lord, Noah Berry, Jr. (as a colorful Mexican), Martha Hyer, Marguerite Chapman, even Ann Robinson (\"War of the Worlds\"), Gloria Talbott (\"I Married a Monster from Outer Space\") It ran for EIGHT SEASONS, over 200 episodes, from January, 1959, to December, 1965. Eric Fleming is quite remarkable as trail boss Gil Favor, the most stolid man that's ever lived, with the code of honor of a Samurai, and just the right balance between toughness and open handedness. I would vote for him for President any day. (P.S. He had a very interesting biography: http:  www.imdb.com name nm0281661  ) And a young Clint Eastwood is quite striking as his impulsive right hand, \"Rowdy\" Yates. Also, veteran Western actor and country music figure (the immortal \"One eyed, One horned, Flying Purple People Eater\") Sheb Wooley is there as seasoned scout Pete Nolan. And Paul Brinegar makes the most cantankerous character of a cook you could ask for as \"Wishbone\". And then there's that great theme song, performed by the immortal Frankie Laine. (Between that and the \"Maverick\" theme, I've got Western theme songs running through my head all day.) I look forward to every episode; I'm collecting the whole set. A good time (not to mention a moo ving experience) is always guaranteed, as one waits to see if the boys will get their difficulties straightened out before the commercial. \"Rollin', rollin', rollin' . . . \"   \n","\n","    label  \n","36    pos  \n","231   pos  \n","278   pos  \n","388   pos  \n","423   pos  "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-7a3cc172-7804-404f-83bc-f5d9952c36ae\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","      <th>label</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>36</th>\n","      <td>The person who wrote the review \"enough with the sweating and spitting already\" has no grasp of what cultural, literary, or psycho  critique is.

But to be honest there is not one person connected to this show that I did not like, even those that only were in for a few episodes (Sheri Appleby for example). The acting and characters are so easy to like and so talented!!. I wish ABC had given this show more of a chance, and not interrupted the show midway, Also it was not advertised enough. Truly unfair!! to everyone!!. This show showed great promise. I for one will let ABC know how I feel and will keep sending emails to keep this show alive. Please join me, I know we can do it. It worked for Jerico. (By the way where is episode 13? I want that last show!). Please support this show and send emails to ABC,we can do it!!! This show is well worth it!!!

I supposed I am quite obsessed by chess, but hopefully not as much as the central character in this film. In this film, the central character reflects a real chess player called Curt von Bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924. He is famous for a game he played against Steinitz, where a beautiful combination was played by Steinitz. Instead of resigning, he simply walked out of the tournament hall, never to return. The social ineptness of the central character is unfortunately a treat of some of the more serious Grandmasters you sometimes get in chess tournaments. Chess I suppose is a very big sacrifice, and you can sometimes end up imbalanced in other areas of life. A major example of this is the chess legend Bobby Fischer. Although a genius, he was also very disturbed in many ways. In the film, a World championship match is depicted, as between an Italian Grandmaster and Luzhin. The format is a knockout, which actually the world Governing body of Fide has sometimes employed as a format itself   going from 128 players to just 2 in the final.

I supposed I am quite obsessed by chess, but hopefully not as much as the central character in this film. In this film, the central character reflects a real chess player called Curt von Bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924. He is famous for a game he played against Steinitz, where a beautiful combination was played by Steinitz. Instead of resigning, he simply walked out of the tournament hall, never to return. The social ineptness of the central character is unfortunately a treat of some of the more serious Grandmasters you sometimes get in chess tournaments. Chess I suppose is a very big sacrifice, and you can sometimes end up imbalanced in other areas of life. A major example of this is the chess legend Bobby Fischer. Although a genius, he was also very disturbed in many ways. In the film, a World championship match is depicted, as between an Italian Grandmaster and Luzhin. The format is a knockout, which actually the world Governing body of Fide has sometimes employed as a format itself   going from 128 players to just 2 in the final. But this was a group knockout   which also depicts a realistic format, where the winners of each group play against each other.

This show is so good, the writing and storyline were great, an actual original idea for a show instead of another boring reality show. The casting was spectacular! Not only were the characters and actors right on, but these are a very talented set of actors. The concept and idea is really a new and cool idea for a TV show, many of us share this whole idea of \"connections\". I really love the characters of Steven, Laura, Whitney and Damien. But to be honest there is not one person connected to this show that I did not like, even those that only were in for a few episodes (Sheri Appleby for example). The acting and characters are so easy to like and so talented!!. I wish ABC had given this show more of a chance, and not interrupted the show midway, Also it was not advertised enough. Truly unfair!! to everyone!!. This show showed great promise. I for one will let ABC know how I feel and will keep sending emails to keep this show alive. Please join me, I know we can do it. It worked for Jerico. (By the way where is episode 13? I want that last show!). Please support this show and send emails to ABC,we can do it!!! This show is well worth it!!!

SIGN THIS PETITION ASAP!!!   \n","423  Currently on METOO's new schedule at 4 pm on weekdays, right after \"Maverick\" and right before \"Wild, Wild West\" (followed by \"Star Trek\"). Don't know if I ever actually saw an episode of it when it was originally on, but I'm really captivated by it. Offbeat, unusual, surreal stories set in a mythical West. Kind of the \"Naked City\" of Westerns. And the guest stars are there: Dan Duryea, Lyle Bettger, Brian Donlevy, MacDonald Carey, Rick Jason (as a treacherous Mexican), a young Dick Van Patten, Jack Lord, Noah Berry, Jr. (as a colorful Mexican), Martha Hyer, Marguerite Chapman, even Ann Robinson (\"War of the Worlds\"), Gloria Talbott (\"I Married a Monster from Outer Space\") It ran for EIGHT SEASONS, over 200 episodes, from January, 1959, to December, 1965. Eric Fleming is quite remarkable as trail boss Gil Favor, the most stolid man that's ever lived, with the code of honor of a Samurai, and just the right balance between toughness and open handedness. I would vote for him for President any day. (P.S. He had a very interesting biography: http:  www.imdb.com name nm0281661  ) And a young Clint Eastwood is quite striking as his impulsive right hand, \"Rowdy\" Yates. Also, veteran Western actor and country music figure (the immortal \"One eyed, One horned, Flying Purple People Eater\") Sheb Wooley is there as seasoned scout Pete Nolan. And Paul Brinegar makes the most cantankerous character of a cook you could ask for as \"Wishbone\". And then there's that great theme song, performed by the immortal Frankie Laine. (Between that and the \"Maverick\" theme, I've got Western theme songs running through my head all day.) I look forward to every episode; I'm collecting the whole set. A good time (not to mention a moo ving experience) is always guaranteed, as one waits to see if the boys will get their difficulties straightened out before the commercial. \"Rollin', rollin', rollin' . . . \"   \n","\n","    label  \n","36    pos  \n","231   pos  \n","278   pos  \n","388   pos  \n","423   pos  "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-2d94da04-c31a-4200-869a-eeb42af8e801\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","      <th>label</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>36</th>\n","      <td>The person who wrote the review \"enough with the sweating and spitting already\" has no grasp of what cultural, literary, or psycho  critique is.

This show is so good, the writing and storyline were great, an actual original idea for a show instead of another boring reality show. The casting was spectacular! Not only were the characters and actors right on, but these are a very talented set of actors. The concept and idea is really a new and cool idea for a TV show, many of us share this whole idea of \"connections\". I really love the characters of Steven, Laura, Whitney and Damien. But to be honest there is not one person connected to this show that I did not like, even those that only were in for a few episodes (Sheri Appleby for example). The acting and characters are so easy to like and so talented!!. I wish ABC had given this show more of a chance, and not interrupted the show midway, Also it was not advertised enough. Truly unfair!! to everyone!!. This show showed great promise. I for one will let ABC know how I feel and will keep sending emails to keep this show alive. Please join me, I know we can do it. It worked for Jerico. (By the way where is episode 13? I want that last show!). Please support this show and send emails to ABC,we can do it!!! This show is well worth it!!!

Don't know if I ever actually saw an episode of it when it was originally on, but I'm really captivated by it. Offbeat, unusual, surreal stories set in a mythical West. Kind of the \"Naked City\" of Westerns. And the guest stars are there: Dan Duryea, Lyle Bettger, Brian Donlevy, MacDonald Carey, Rick Jason (as a treacherous Mexican), a young Dick Van Patten, Jack Lord, Noah Berry, Jr. (as a colorful Mexican), Martha Hyer, Marguerite Chapman, even Ann Robinson (\"War of the Worlds\"), Gloria Talbott (\"I Married a Monster from Outer Space\") It ran for EIGHT SEASONS, over 200 episodes, from January, 1959, to December, 1965. Eric Fleming is quite remarkable as trail boss Gil Favor, the most stolid man that's ever lived, with the code of honor of a Samurai, and just the right balance between toughness and open handedness. I would vote for him for President any day. (P.S. He had a very interesting biography: http:  www.imdb.com name nm0281661  ) And a young Clint Eastwood is quite striking as his impulsive right hand, \"Rowdy\" Yates. Also, veteran Western actor and country music figure (the immortal \"One eyed, One horned, Flying Purple People Eater\") Sheb Wooley is there as seasoned scout Pete Nolan. And Paul Brinegar makes the most cantankerous character of a cook you could ask for as \"Wishbone\". And then there's that great theme song, performed by the immortal Frankie Laine. (Between that and the \"Maverick\" theme, I've got Western theme songs running through my head all day.) I look forward to every episode; I'm collecting the whole set. A good time (not to mention a moo ving experience) is always guaranteed, as one waits to see if the boys will get their difficulties straightened out before the commercial. \"Rollin', rollin', rollin' . . . \"</td>\n","      <td>pos</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-2d94da04-c31a-4200-869a-eeb42af8e801')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-2d94da04-c31a-4200-869a-eeb42af8e801 button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

Robert Carlyle isn't Hitler he is a man who sadly tries to be Hitler. The Movie lies, it doesn't reflect the truth. In the scene were Hitler hit the guy with his gun. Hitler never had hit anybody, he wouldn't hit people with his fist, but with the fists of soldiers. Understand?? Another thing is: It is too obvious, that Hitler is that evil, he was more clever, than shown in this movie. No German would have accepted him as the leader, because the can see that he is evil. So the real Hitler haven't shown his evil side to the people. Have any of you Yankees watched the movie \\\"Der Untergang\\\" or \\\"The Dawnfall\\\"? this is a great movie, with amazing actors. And its a German movie. I think, this Theme of Nazi Germany, should not be realized as a movie by people who don't know anything of Germany. People! Watch \\\"Der Untergang\\\":  http:  www.imdb.com title tt0363163  Its a great movie about a very sad period of time for human beings around the world.\",\n          \"Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) has just been dumped by his wife, because he is one of the most annoying , neurotic people in the world. Suicide is his way out, but he just can't seem to get it to work, so he heads over to his friends house. Oscar Madison (Walther Matthau) is also recently divorced and living it up in bachelor heaven. Smoking, gambling, hitting on chicks, eating out and never cleaning is paradise to him. Well, with the suicide attempts Oscar decides to let Felix move in. At first, it is a match made in heaven, Felix cooks and cleans and helps Oscar pay his alimony on time, but soon Oscar is jonesing for women and Felix (who in today's world would probably be gay) isn't ready to move on. They invite a couple of British birds over and they find Felix so tender that soon they and Felix are weeping and chatting about his family life, leaving Oscar denied. This is it, he explodes and throws him out, but Felix isn't as helpless as it seems, and soon he has the upper hand. My favorite quote \\\"You leave me little notes on my pillow. Told you 158 times I can't stand little notes on my pillow. \\\"We're all out of cornflakes. F.U.\\\" Took me three hours to figure out F.U. was Felix Ungar!\\\" Based on a Neil Simon play (who also wrote the screenplay), this has a certain theatre feel to it. Set and the repartee and looks feel quite play like (for better or worse). Lemmon and Mathau have excellent comedic chemistry and have appeared in the Grumpier Old Men movies and Out to Sea, reprising the same finicky slob roles, but with different names (to avoid royalty issues, I'm sure). This movie is like strawberries dipped in chocolate. The chocolate is smooth, sweet and rich, the strawberry is tart, juicy and bright red (unless you get those nasty greenish ones). They are almost polar opposites, but together, the contrasts highlight each other and make a wonderful dessert. 7 10  http:  blog.myspace.com locoformovies\",\n          \"Anyone who has studied any physics or cognitive science will walk out disgusted after 40 min., as my wife and I did.

I'm offended by such nonsense presented under the guise of \\\"science\\\". I can only conclude that the writers picked up a quantum physics book, didn't understand a word of it, then watched The Matrix about a thousand times, and proceeded to write this movie.

Not only were the characters and actors right on, but these are a very talented set of actors. The concept and idea is really a new and cool idea for a TV show, many of us share this whole idea of \"connections\". I really love the characters of Steven, Laura, Whitney and Damien. But to be honest there is not one person connected to this show that I did not like, even those that only were in for a few episodes (Sheri Appleby for example). The acting and characters are so easy to like and so talented!!. I wish ABC had given this show more of a chance, and not interrupted the show midway, Also it was not advertised enough. Truly unfair!! to everyone!!. This show showed great promise. I for one will let ABC know how I feel and will keep sending emails to keep this show alive. Please join me, I know we can do it. It worked for Jerico. (By the way where is episode 13? I want that last show!). Please support this show and send emails to ABC,we can do it!!! This show is well worth it!!!

SIGN THIS PETITION ASAP!!!   \n","423  Currently on METOO's new schedule at 4 pm on weekdays, right after \"Maverick\" and right before \"Wild, Wild West\" (followed by \"Star Trek\"). Don't know if I ever actually saw an episode of it when it was originally on, but I'm really captivated by it. Offbeat, unusual, surreal stories set in a mythical West. Kind of the \"Naked City\" of Westerns. And the guest stars are there: Dan Duryea, Lyle Bettger, Brian Donlevy, MacDonald Carey, Rick Jason (as a treacherous Mexican), a young Dick Van Patten, Jack Lord, Noah Berry, Jr. (as a colorful Mexican), Martha Hyer, Marguerite Chapman, even Ann Robinson (\"War of the Worlds\"), Gloria Talbott (\"I Married a Monster from Outer Space\") It ran for EIGHT SEASONS, over 200 episodes, from January, 1959, to December, 1965. Eric Fleming is quite remarkable as trail boss Gil Favor, the most stolid man that's ever lived, with the code of honor of a Samurai, and just the right balance between toughness and open handedness. I would vote for him for President any day. (P.S. He had a very interesting biography: http:  www.imdb.com name nm0281661  ) And a young Clint Eastwood is quite striking as his impulsive right hand, \"Rowdy\" Yates. Also, veteran Western actor and country music figure (the immortal \"One eyed, One horned, Flying Purple People Eater\") Sheb Wooley is there as seasoned scout Pete Nolan. And Paul Brinegar makes the most cantankerous character of a cook you could ask for as \"Wishbone\". And then there's that great theme song, performed by the immortal Frankie Laine. (Between that and the \"Maverick\" theme, I've got Western theme songs running through my head all day.) I look forward to every episode; I'm collecting the whole set. A good time (not to mention a moo ving experience) is always guaranteed, as one waits to see if the boys will get their difficulties straightened out before the commercial. \"Rollin', rollin', rollin' . . . \"   \n","997                                                                                                             I loved the way EARTH is made. Its photography is unbelievable, editing it must have been an interesting challenge and Patrick Stewart's voice over is PERFECT. In addition its music and sound editing make watching EARTH a profound experience you don't want to miss. You really are on a journey to where you would probably never ever end up by yourself.  And although, at first, I was quite surprised by the laughter of the audience as we see animals in their daily fight for survival, I could not help laughing myself sometimes. Nature simply seems too impressive to comprehend. But, rather than the need to laugh, I left the cinema with a profound question:\"Howcome 200 years of industrial revolution can destroy natural systems that have been here for thousands and thousands of years?\" With this question in mind, you'll understand how I felt somewhat bitter and powerless after seeing EARTH. I felt the immediate need to change the world, to help all these animals in their struggle, to undo the changes we have gone through the last centuries and to stop the global heating at once (all that not being a NGO activist at all!)... So I immediately visited the website mentioned at the end of the film to see what I could do to save our  still  fantastic planet (and the polar bear) from its depressing fate... (www.loveearth.com) I was a little disappointed to find no direct answers to my questions there. Yet it was very interesting to find out more about the film and the struggle its crew went through. I hope that cutting on my energy use will do. I don't know how else to shorten the distance polar bears have to swim to reach land before they drown or attack animals they cannot beat in their exhausted state... An inspiring film it is, but I didn't leave the cinema feeling very happy.   \n","\n","    label  \n","29    pos  \n","248   pos  \n","388   pos  \n","423   pos  \n","997   pos  "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-657cdfdf-e914-4c5a-b69c-1a88712c5ab0\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","      <th>label</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>29</th>\n","      <td>I've watched it plenty of times and I'm planning on buying the full feature.

The concept and idea is really a new and cool idea for a TV show, many of us share this whole idea of \"connections\". I really love the characters of Steven, Laura, Whitney and Damien. But to be honest there is not one person connected to this show that I did not like, even those that only were in for a few episodes (Sheri Appleby for example). The acting and characters are so easy to like and so talented!!. I wish ABC had given this show more of a chance, and not interrupted the show midway, Also it was not advertised enough. Truly unfair!! to everyone!!. This show showed great promise. I for one will let ABC know how I feel and will keep sending emails to keep this show alive. Please join me, I know we can do it. It worked for Jerico. (By the way where is episode 13? I want that last show!). Please support this show and send emails to ABC,we can do it!!! This show is well worth it!!!

Don't know if I ever actually saw an episode of it when it was originally on, but I'm really captivated by it. Offbeat, unusual, surreal stories set in a mythical West. Kind of the \"Naked City\" of Westerns. And the guest stars are there: Dan Duryea, Lyle Bettger, Brian Donlevy, MacDonald Carey, Rick Jason (as a treacherous Mexican), a young Dick Van Patten, Jack Lord, Noah Berry, Jr. (as a colorful Mexican), Martha Hyer, Marguerite Chapman, even Ann Robinson (\"War of the Worlds\"), Gloria Talbott (\"I Married a Monster from Outer Space\") It ran for EIGHT SEASONS, over 200 episodes, from January, 1959, to December, 1965. Eric Fleming is quite remarkable as trail boss Gil Favor, the most stolid man that's ever lived, with the code of honor of a Samurai, and just the right balance between toughness and open handedness. I would vote for him for President any day. (P.S. He had a very interesting biography: http:  www.imdb.com name nm0281661  ) And a young Clint Eastwood is quite striking as his impulsive right hand, \"Rowdy\" Yates. Also, veteran Western actor and country music figure (the immortal \"One eyed, One horned, Flying Purple People Eater\") Sheb Wooley is there as seasoned scout Pete Nolan. And Paul Brinegar makes the most cantankerous character of a cook you could ask for as \"Wishbone\". And then there's that great theme song, performed by the immortal Frankie Laine. (Between that and the \"Maverick\" theme, I've got Western theme songs running through my head all day.) I look forward to every episode; I'm collecting the whole set. A good time (not to mention a moo ving experience) is always guaranteed, as one waits to see if the boys will get their difficulties straightened out before the commercial. \"Rollin', rollin', rollin' . . . \"</td>\n","      <td>pos</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>997</th>\n","      <td>I loved the way EARTH is made.

These grandeur fantasies would only transpire if the filmmakers (Carrey included) would possess the powers of God. That very same premise is the paramount ingredient in Carrey's new laugh riot `Bruce Almighty'. Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a televison reporter who is so utterly obsessed in being the main anchor that he holds God to total culpability for his own contretemps. God, heavenly played by Morgan Freeman, grants Bruce the `Gift of God'(his powers) in order to challenge him if he can do God's job any better. Obviously, Bruce gets `carreyed' away with his newfound blissful faculties and uses them selfishly. Carrey is back in his habitual almighty comedic form in `Bruce Almighty'. Jennifer Aniston was not `mis.pittiful' as Bruce's girlfriend. However, my premier kudos goes to Director Tom Shadyac for not letting the dog out of the house for #2, and showing us the most hilarious doggoned bathroom scene of all time! `Bruce Almighty' is not the most in depth Carrey film, but it is still an almighty chuckling exhibition of `Carreyism'! **** Good   \n","334                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           This film is like marmite. You either love it or you hate it. If you go into this film expecting a proper film with decent production values, a good plot and great characters you'll hate it. If you go into this film expecting a low budget slasher you'll probably hate it. If you go into this film expecting to see one of the most deranged characters ever put to film in the form of Harry Russo you will love it. John Giancaspro is absolutely brilliant in his over the top portrayal of the insane, murderous coke fiend. The special effects are abysmal at best but really, who cares? If you're the kind of person who's prepared to watch a film Schizophreniac: The Whore Mangler you've undoubtedly seen scores of horror films filled with gore. With the budget this film was made for even if they had tried it probably would've mediocre at best. I'd much rather be able to laugh at something abysmal than be unaffected by the mediocre. To sum it up, you'll probably hate this film but if you're one of the few who decide to see it anyway it'll become the best thing since sliced bread #2 I hate marmite.   \n","509                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Kim Novak's a witch on the prowl for a mortal lover, and James Stewart's her choice. Scintillating comedy of manners, from the Broadway stage; shot by James Wong Howe in Witch Color, and performed by a sterling cast.

It's more realistic than all this crap about racing stolen cars that are too expensive for someone in that area could afford (*cough2Fast2Furiouscough*) There is some humor though... i.e. the Pelicangs and the light 80s music.

You either love it or you hate it. If you go into this film expecting a proper film with decent production values, a good plot and great characters you'll hate it. If you go into this film expecting a low budget slasher you'll probably hate it. If you go into this film expecting to see one of the most deranged characters ever put to film in the form of Harry Russo you will love it. John Giancaspro is absolutely brilliant in his over the top portrayal of the insane, murderous coke fiend. The special effects are abysmal at best but really, who cares? If you're the kind of person who's prepared to watch a film Schizophreniac: The Whore Mangler you've undoubtedly seen scores of horror films filled with gore. With the budget this film was made for even if they had tried it probably would've mediocre at best. I'd much rather be able to laugh at something abysmal than be unaffected by the mediocre. To sum it up, you'll probably hate this film but if you're one of the few who decide to see it anyway it'll become the best thing since sliced bread #2 I hate marmite.\",\n          \"Very few movies have had the impact on American culture the way Urban Cowboy has. Thank god it was temporary. But UC is almost in a class by itself as one of those flicks that when you're flipping channels at 3:00AM you just can't take your eyes off....my top three are Animal House and Walking Tall BTW but that's beside the point. I remember Urban Cowboy hit the theaters and overnite there were honkytonks being opened on every corner, men were sporting cowboy hats with their penny loafers, and if you didnt know how to two step you were considered a social moron! Personally I think it's a great movie. Travolta really surprised me on the heels of SatNiteFever. Who'd a thunk. He's actually believable too. The soundtrack is awesome. Too bad Charlene Tilton, of TV's Dallas fame ruined Johnny Lee's career cause that guy was just terrific. The show stealer here is Scott Glenn as the greaser ex con redneck cowboy. And I ain't got nothing against greaser ex con cowboys semi being one myself, but I've always envied what I feel to be the greatest power line of all time....\\\"Pack at S*#t!\\\" Sort of like Clint's \\\"make my day.\\\" And watching him slap Sissy around is the closest thing I'll see to my Julia Roberts fantasy so.....
